# Shadowverse Evolve Eco Proxies
Need a way to test cards before committing to the big purchase? These eco proxies have you covered. As a bonus, they are purely black and white, so it saves your ink and toner. The bigger bonus is that the text on the card is much larger, making it a heckuva lot easier to read compared to a normal, full art Shadowverse Evolve card.

## Special thanks
This project was inspired by [fab-eco-proxy](https://aongaro.github.io/fab-eco-proxy/). I went looking for Shadowverse proxies to test a couple decks, and after seeing the full art and full color proxies, my wallet starting crying. I remember seeing these eco proxies for Flesh and Blood and thought the concept would transition over nicely.
