# Shadowverse Evolve Eco Proxies
Need a way to test cards before committing to the big purchase? These eco proxies have you covered. As a bonus, they are purely black and white, so it saves your ink and toner (and wallet). The bigger bonus is that the text on the card is much larger, making it much easier to read compared to a normal Shadowverse Evolve card.

## Special Thanks
This project was inspired by [fab-eco-proxy](https://aongaro.github.io/fab-eco-proxy/). I went looking for Shadowverse proxies to test a couple decks, and after seeing the full art and full color proxies, my wallet starting crying. I remember seeing these eco proxies for Flesh and Blood and thought the concept would transition over nicely.
